Datatypes
=========

There are known issues related to Python/DB data types.

Dates and Times
---------------

When using `Django-mssql` with SQL Server 2005, all of the date related fields
only support the `datetime` data type. Support for these legacy data types can
be enabled using the :setting:`use_legacy_date_fields` option, or using the 
fields ``LegacyDateField``,  ``LegacyDateTimeField``, and ``LegacyTimeField`` in
``sqlserver_ado.fields``.

To allow migrating specific apps or only some of your models to the new date 
times, the model fields ``DateField``, ``DateTimeField``, and ``TimeField`` in
``sqlserver_ado.fields`` use the new data types regardless of the 
:setting:`use_legacy_date_fields` option.

.. code:: python

	from django.db import models
	from sqlserver_ado.fields import DateField, DateTimeField, TimeField

	class MyModel(models.Model):
		# when use_legecy_date_fields is False, models.*Field will behave like these
		a_real_date = DateField() # date data type
		a_datetime2 = DateTimeField() # datetime2 data type
		a_real_time = TimeField() # time data type

		# when use_legecy_date_fields is True, models.*Field will behave like these
		a_date = LegacyDateField() # datetime data type
		a_datetime = LegacyDateTime() # datetime data type
		a_time = LegacyTimeField() # datetime data type

datetime limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With SQL Server 2005, only the `datetime`_ data type is usable with Django. This
data type does not store enough precision to provide the full range of Python
datetime dates and will round to increments of .000, .003, or .007 seconds. The
earliest supported datetime date value is January 1, 1753.

.. _`datetime`: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187819.aspx

SQL Server 2008 introduces a datetime2_ type, with support for fractional 
seconds and the full range of Python datetime dates. To use this time, either
set the :settings:`use_legacy_date_fields` option to ``False`` or use the 
``sqlserver_ado.fields.DateTimeField`` with your models.

bigint
------

Prior to Django 1.3, ``bigint`` was not provided. This backend provided model
fields to allow using the ``bigint`` datatype.

.. currentmodule:: sqlserver_ado.fields

.. class:: BigAutoField

This is a ``django.db.models.AutoField`` for the ``bigint`` datatype.


.. class:: BigIntegerField

This was previously an ``django.db.models.IntegerField`` that specified the
``bigint`` datatype. As of Django 1.3, ``django.db.models.BigIntegerField``
is provided and should be used instead.


.. class:: BigForeignKey

This is a ``django.db.models.ForeignKey`` that should be used to reference
either a ``BigAutoField`` or a ``BigIntegerField``.

.. note::
    If your (legacy) database using bigints for primary keys, then you'll 
    need to replace any introspected ``ForeignKey`` fields with 
    ``BigForeignKey`` for things to work as expected.


money
-----

The ``money`` and ``smallmoney`` data types will be introspected as 
``DecimalField`` with the appropriate values for ``max_digits`` and 
``decimal_places``. This does not mean that they are expected to work without
issue.

Unsupported Types
-----------------

These types may behave oddly in a Django application, as they have limits 
smaller than what Django expects from similar types:

- smalldatetime
- tinyint
- real
