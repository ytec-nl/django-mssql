.. setting:: DATABASES

DATABASES
---------

Please see the `Django documentation on DATABASES settings`_ for a complete 
list of available settings. `Django-mssql` builds upon these settings.
 
 .. _`Django documentation on DATABASES settings`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/settings/#databases
 
 
This is an example of a typical configuration::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'NAME': 'my_database',
            'ENGINE': 'sqlserver_ado',
            'HOST': 'dbserver\\ss2008',
            'USER': '',
            'PASSWORD': '',
        }
    }


.. setting:: ENGINE

ENGINE
~~~~~~

This value must be set to ``sqlserver_ado``.

.. setting:: HOST

HOST
~~~~

Default: ``'127.0.0.1'``

This defines the Microsoft SQL Server to establish a connection. This value 
can be a hostname or IP address.

.. setting:: PORT

PORT
~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

This defines the network port to use when connecting to the server. If not 
defined, the standard Microsoft SQL Server port will be used.

.. setting:: NAME

NAME
~~~~

This is the name of the SQL server database.

.. setting:: USER

USER
~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

This defines the name of the user to use when authenticating to the server.
When empty, a trusted connection (SSPI) will be used.

.. setting:: PASSWORD

PASSWORD
~~~~~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

When a `USER`_ is defined, this field should be the plain text password 
to use when authenticating.

.. note: 
    Any user or service that can read the configuration file can 
    will be able to see the plain-text password. Trusted connections are 
    recommended.

.. setting:: OPTIONS

OPTIONS
-------

``Django-mssql`` provides a few extra ``OPTIONS`` that are specific to this
backend. Please note that while the main database settings are UPPERCASE
keys, the ``OPTIONS`` dictionary keys are expected to be lowercase (due to
legacy reasons).

.. setting:: use_mars

use_mars
~~~~~~~~

Default: ``True``

Set to ``False`` to disable `Multiple Active Recordsets`. It is not recommended 
to disable MARS. Without MARS enabled, you will probably end up seeing the error
"Cannot create new connection because in manual or distributed transaction mode".

.. note::
    This doesn't really work properly with the "SQLOLEDB" provider.


.. _`extra_params`: OPTIONS-EXTRA_PARAMS

.. setting:: extra_params

extra_params
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``''`` (Empty string)

This value will be appended to the generated connection string. Use this to
provide any specific connection settings that are not controllable with the
other settings.

.. setting:: provider

provider
~~~~~~~~

Default: ``'SQLCLI10'``

The SQL provider to use when connecting to the database. If this doesn't work, 
try 'SQLCLI11' or 'SQLOLEDB'.

.. note::
    ``use_mars = True`` doesn't always work properly with 'SQLOLEDB' and can result in the error 
    "Cannot create new connection because in manual or distributed transaction mode."
    if you try to filter a queryset with another queryset.

.. setting:: disable_avg_cast

disable_avg_cast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default: ``False``

This backend will automatically ``CAST`` fields used by the `AVG function`_ 
as ``FLOAT`` to match the behavior of the core database backends. Set this
to ``True`` if you need SQL server to retain the datatype of fields used
with ``AVG``.

.. versionadded:: 1.1

.. _`AVG function`: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177677.aspx

.. note::
    SQL server maintains the datatype of the values used in ``AVG``. The
    average of an ``int`` column will be an ``int``. With this option set
    to ``True``, ``AVG([1,2])`` == 1, not 1.5.
